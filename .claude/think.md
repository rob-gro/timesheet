# /think - Quick Reminder to Analyze First

**Short version of /analyze-first**

---

## STOP. READ. THINK. VERIFY. THEN ACT.

You're rushing. Follow the protocol:

1. **READ** all relevant files (not assumptions)
2. **TRACE** the complete flow (Frontend → API → Service → DB)
3. **UNDERSTAND** the root cause (not just symptoms)
4. **VERIFY** your solution will work (before claiming it will)
5. **ONE solution** - not 10 iterations

**Remember:** Senior developers fix things ONCE, not ten times.

Read → Understand → Fix correctly → Done.

Not: Guess → "Will work!" → Doesn't work → Repeat 10x.
